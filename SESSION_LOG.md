# Session Log

## Prior Summary
Wan2GP has been refactored into a headless, CLI-first toolkit where queue orchestration, structured logging, and manifest emission replace the legacy Gradio surface. `cli.queue_controller` now manages scheduling, pause/resume, and control-port traffic while `cli.runner`/`cli.generate` keep notifier wiring and deterministic abort handling aligned with `ProductionManager.run_generation()`. The runtime wrapper clones metadata templates, prepares adapter payloads (prompt enhancer, LoRA), and delegates to `wgp.generate_video` without mutating legacy globals. Persistence flows consolidated on `core.io.media.MediaPersistenceContext`, replacing `shared.utils.audio_video.save_*`; video/image/audio/mask saves now share retry-aware writers, respect codec/container templates, and feed a JSONL manifest via `ManifestRecorder`. Documentation across `docs/CLI.md`, `docs/APPENDIX_HEADLESS.md`, and `PROJECT_PLAN_LIVE.md` stays aligned, and `LIVE_CONTEXT.md` captures architectural decisions plus remaining dependency extractions.

MatAnyOne preprocessing mirrors the same pipeline. The CLI clones `ProductionManager.metadata_state()`, honours the shared media context, optionally reattaches source audio, and persists mask archives according to `save_masks`. Regression suites (`tests/test_matanyone_persistence.py`, `tests/test_matanyone_cli_integration.py`, `tests/test_matanyone_manifest.py`, `tests/test_queue_audio_metadata.py`, `tests/test_queue_prompt_payloads.py`) protect manifest schema, queue payload propagation, and the enriched audio metadata path (`sample_rate`, `duration_s`, `language`, `channels`, `source_codec`). Queue telemetry now surfaces audio-track metadata across summaries and the TCP status endpoint, keeping orchestration clients synchronised with MatAnyOne outputs.

## 2025-11-02 (Session 12)
- Enumerated the documentation roster in `PROJECT_PLAN_LIVE.md` by replacing the `docs/*` wildcard with explicit entries for each file under `docs/`, each accompanied by a short scope description to make the handoff plan self-contained.
- Reviewed every document (`docs/AMD-INSTALLATION.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/FINETUNES.md`, `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`, `docs/INSTALLATION.md`, `docs/IO_MEDIA_MIGRATION.md`, `docs/LORAS.md`, `docs/MODELS.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/VACE.md`, `docs/WORK_HISTORY.md`) to confirm context before summarising, ensuring the plan accurately reflects their coverage.
- No validation commands were executed; documentation-only maintenance.
